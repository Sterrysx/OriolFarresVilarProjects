# Simulation of a 4-Player Game with Graph Algorithms

## Introduction:

This project simulates a complex 4-player game set on the planet Crematoria, incorporating graph algorithms to manage interactions among various units.

## How to Run:

### Compilation:

To compile the game, run the following command in the terminal:
```bash
make all
```

Execute the game with the following command:
```bash
./Game SterrySX Demo Demo Demo -s 30 -i default.cnf -o default.res
```

Viewing the Match:
After compilation and execution, follow these steps to witness the match:

  1. Go to the Game folder (unzip it).
  2. Navigate to the viewer folder.
  3. Open the "viewer.html" file.
  4. Select the "default.res" file in the Game folder.

## Project Background:
### Crematoria:
The game is based on the planet Crematoria, a once uninhabitable place turned into a battleground for four rival groups of pioneers. The surface, once a maximum-security prison, is now sought after for its valuable gems.

### Game Rules:
The game involves 4 players, each controlling a group of pioneers and Furyans.
Goals include conquering cave cells and collecting gems.
Units include Pioneers, Furyans, Hellhounds, and Necromongers, each with unique abilities.
The game lasts for 120 rounds, and the winner is the group with the most points.
### Game Mechanics:
Movement is allowed on a board with two levels (underground and outside).
Gems generate under sunlight, and the sun's movement affects gameplay.
Units can attack, conquer cells, and collect gems.



## Additional Information:
For those interested in delving deeper into the project, I extend an open invitation to schedule a meeting at your convenience. During this meeting, I will provide an in-depth explanation, address any inquiries, and further explore the intricate details of this project.
