## Operational Implementation of OOPS-3DVAR within the IFS/HARMONIE-AROME NWP Model

In collaboration with Pau Escrib√† of AEMET, this study delineates the procedural intricacies of an operational OOPS-3DVAR Data Assimilation endeavor deployed in conjunction with the IFS/HARMONIE-AROME
Numerical Weather Prediction model. 
Notably, the OOPS framework orchestrates this process, serving as a pivotal intermediary layer, seamlessly integrating the C++ control with the underlying Fortran 
codebase. The employment of the DDT-forge debugger is instrumental in scrutinizing and refining the workflow. Acknowledged as state-of-the-art methodologies, the OOPS-3/4DVAR algorithms assume paramount 
importance in initializing the predictive state within both the IFS and HARMONIE-AROME NWP models. 
This collaborative effort significantly contributes to the progressive advancement of the HARMONIE community, laying the groundwork for the subsequent refinement and 
evolution of the more sophisticated OOPS-4DVAR algorithm.
