My Experience at AEMET: Bridging Expertise through Coding

Introduction:
During my four-week engagement at AEMET, the esteemed Spanish Meteorologic Center, I had the honor of serving as a C++ data scientist. In this capacity, my primary responsibility was to facilitate a better understanding of C++ code among AEMET staff members who had varying degrees of coding expertise. This role proved to be a unique blend of technical proficiency and meteorological insight.

Fostering Synergy: Coding and Meteorology Unite
Intriguingly, the AEMET workforce consisted of both meteorologists and individuals without traditional coding backgrounds. Given the multifaceted nature of their tasks, it was evident that coding was at the heart of their operations, accounting for over 90% of their daily work. This scenario presented an exciting challenge and an opportunity for collaboration.

Decoding Complexity: Navigating the BEST Prediction System
One remarkable achievement during my tenure involved collaborating on the complex BEST prediction systemâ€”an intricate piece of software that demanded a deep understanding of its codebase. Through persistent teamwork and collective effort, we systematically unraveled each facet of the BEST prediction system. This endeavor allowed us to comprehensively grasp its functionalities and marked a significant milestone in our pursuit of enhanced comprehension.

Learning Beyond Borders: Collaborating with European Experts
In addition to internal collaboration, I engaged in enlightening discussions with Senior Data Analysts hailing from esteemed institutions across Europe, including the European Meteorologic Center in Oslo and Switzerland. These interactions proved invaluable, infusing our team with new perspectives and insights to tackle specific challenges. The shared expertise from these accomplished professionals enriched our problem-solving repertoire and broadened our strategic capabilities.

Foundation for Success: Transitioning from Year One
Crucially, I embarked on this enriching journey immediately after completing my first year of studies in Computer Science Engineering. Despite being at an early stage in my academic journey, I found my foundational knowledge in programming and computer science to be highly applicable. This experience underscored my adaptability and aptitude for seamlessly integrating into AEMET's dynamic work environment.

A Transformative Experience: Code, Collaboration, and Progress
In reflection, my time at AEMET was indeed transformative. By acting as a conduit between coding intricacies and meteorological intricacies, I was able to contribute to a more cohesive and efficient workflow. This experience was a testament to the potential of interdisciplinary collaboration and showcased my commitment to continual learning and growth in specialized contexts.
