# 1-Introduction
The main objective is to simulate the operation of a multiprocessor architecture, where each processor exclusively interacts with its own memory and can execute more than one process simultaneously. The cluster consists of a variable number of processors distributed in a binary tree structure, each possessing unique identifiers. The first processor can be any of them. Processors can have zero, one, or two successor processors, also known as auxiliaries. Every cluster must contain a minimum of one processor. Each processor is equipped with a memory that stores and executes processes. This memory is composed of a fixed number of positions indexed from 0. The quantity of memory for each processor may vary.

## Data Decisions
All priority and processor identifiers follow the same format, consisting only of letters and digits. Process identifiers are non-negative integers. The memory for any processor is an integer greater than zero. Reserved memory for a process and its estimated execution time are also integers greater than zero, as well as the number of possible priorities for pending processes. All inputs are assumed to be syntactically correct at all times; no further validation is required. Some functionalities have restricted input data for the sake of execution simplicity.
