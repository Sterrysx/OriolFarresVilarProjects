# Simulation of Interconnected Processors' Performance
Simulation of the operation of a multiprocessor architecture, where each processor works exclusively with its own memory and can execute more than one process simultaneously.
The main program will start by initializing a first cluster without processes. Next, it will initialize an empty waiting area, reading an initial number of priorities n > 0 and the identifiers of n priorities for this purpose. Once the initializations are completed, a series of commands will be processed, including the 'end' command which will terminate the execution.

## Add-ons:
For those interested in delving deeper, I have compiled an extensive document spanning over 50 pages that comprehensively elaborates on every facet of Orbital Executive's development. I extend an open invitation to schedule a meeting at your convenience, during which I would be delighted to provide an in-depth explanation, address any inquiries, and further explore the intricate details of this project.
